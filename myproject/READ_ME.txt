Implementation Strategy
Let's focus on implementation in phases:
Phase 1: Core Backend Functionality

Set up the project structure
Implement basic problem generation for a few key concepts
Create PDF generation with proper formatting
Build the FastAPI endpoints

Phase 2: Expand Problem Generation

Implement all problem types
Add visual elements (clocks, shapes, coins)
Enhance PDF layout and formatting

Phase 3: Frontend Integration

Set up React frontend
Create responsive UI components
Implement form submission and PDF download

Phase 4: Testing and Refinement

Test with different input combinations
Refine problem generation algorithms
Optimize PDF generation

Would you like me to start implementing any specific component of this plan, or would you prefer to focus on a particular aspect of the backend first?RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.Sbased on above codes you provided do you think we finished phase 1 ?EditBased on the code I provided, we've outlined a skeleton for Phase 1, but there are still several components missing to complete the core backend functionality:

Problem Generators: We've defined the structure for the problem generation module, but we need to implement the individual generator functions for each concept (like generate_addition_problem, generate_time_telling_problem, etc.).
PDF Layout Functions: We've created the main PDF generation function, but we need to implement the helper functions like create_spiral_layout(), create_fluency_layout(), and create_answer_key().
Visual Elements: We need to implement the drawing functions for clocks, shapes, coins, and other visual elements that appear in various problem types.
Project Structure Setup: We need to ensure the proper Python package structure with __init__.py files and appropriate imports.
Error Handling: More robust error handling should be added, especially for edge cases.
